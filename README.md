# Air-Quality-Management-in-Developing-Economies

This repository contains an analytical paper comparing the Air Quality Management (AQM) strategies of three developing economies: Poland, Pakistan, and Vietnam. The project investigates the different and similar policies each country is implementing to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) and particulate matter ($PM_{2.5}$, $PM_{10}$) emissions. It evaluates these strategies against the backdrop of rapid industrialization, economic growth, and the challenge of meeting international standards like the Paris Agreement, especially in cities with "very unhealthy" Air Quality Index (AQI) values, such as Krakow and Lahore.

## Key Topics & Comparisons

* ### Poland
    Discusses Poland's challenge with high $PM_{10}$ and $PM_{2.5}$ concentrations, largely due to a heavy reliance on solid fuels for residential heating. The primary strategy analyzed is the **"Clean Air Programme" (CAP)**, which enforces technical requirements and penalties on solid fuel boilers to curb emissions from the residential sector.

* ### Pakistan
    Identifies pollution sources as a large population, rapid vehicle growth (using low-quality fuel), and industrial emissions. The paper highlights unique solutions being implemented, such as **"protected U-turns"** in Lahore to reduce traffic bottlenecks and emissions. It also notes the adoption of industrial technologies like **Flue Gas Desulphurisation** and **Electrostatic Precipitators** in power plants.

* ### Vietnam
    Analyzes Vietnam's air quality, which faces challenges primarily from transportation, specifically a high density of motorcycles. The government's policies focus heavily on improving **public transport**, including developing new bus and railway systems, and promoting cleaner vehicle fuels like **Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)** and **Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG)**.

* ### Similarities
    Compares the common policy threads, noting that both Poland and Pakistan have ambitious national policies to promote **Electric Vehicles (EVs)** (e.g., Pakistan's NEVP and Poland's National Electromobility Development Plan). All three nations show a shared interest in decarbonization and investing in alternative fuels.

* ### Conclusion
    Provides a final evaluation, ranking **Vietnam** as the most effective in AQM due to strong policy enforcement. **Poland** is ranked second, backed by EU regulations but facing implementation challenges. **Pakistan** is deemed the least effective, with its national priorities appearing more focused on industrial growth than environmental management.
